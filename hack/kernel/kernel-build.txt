Clone the the source and get the config file from a working VM whose config one would want to preserve ...

export LMC_KEEP=drivers/net:net
make olddefconfig  
make localmodconfig
# manually add any config options that may still be needed
make -j $(nproc)
# make modules not necessary here but can try if needed 
sudo make modules_install

sudo make install
